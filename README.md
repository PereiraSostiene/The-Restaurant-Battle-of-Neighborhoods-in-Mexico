# The-Restaurant-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-in-Mexico
IBM Capstone project

Mexico City is one of the top places to visit in the world. It has many touristic places such as the historic center (designated a UNESCO World
Heritage Site), colonial-era churches, El Templo Mayor (which preserves vestiges of the great Aztec empire), incredible museums, the Chapultepec Park,
and many others.

Mexico City also possesses an extraordinary gastronomy, but for tourists locating the right place to eat can be complicated and challenging. 
Even for Mexicans in Mexico City, finding the right restaurant is a difficult task.
Once, a friend of mine from India visited Mexico City for a conference. He asked me to show him the city, which I gladly did. Everything was going well
until he told me he was a vegan, because I did not know where to find a restaurant for vegans! Mexican food is spicy, and the most delicious meals
include beef or pork, which is a problem for many people around the world because of cultural, religious or health reasons. 

Then, the purpose of this data science project is to help tourists in Mexico City to find restaurants of their preference. 
That is, in which neighborhoods of Mexico City they will find different options of restaurants (Fast food, Vegetarian food, Italian, Japanese and so on). 
Foreign tourists and also Mexicans are the target audience of this project.

In this project, the K-Means clustering technique was employed to find the neighborhoods of Mexico City in which people can find different options of restaurants. 
Restaurant data were obtained from API calls (city f Calgary, Foursquare).
